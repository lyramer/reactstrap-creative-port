This project is a port of the free [Bootstrap Creative Theme](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/creative/) to a React framework using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/).

I've stripped out the jquery scroll plugin that came with the template as jquery and react don't play nicely together. If I find a workable react-based plugin that offers the functionality that scroll-trigger does, I'll pop it in.

The majority of the changes I've made are in replacing the original plain markup of the template with the reactstrap analogues. I'm mostly stashing this here because I've done this a couple of times in building quick sites for folks and I'm tired of doing the same thing over and over.
